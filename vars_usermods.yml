# Copy this file, place it in the sas-container-recipes project directory,

# The directory where manifests will be created. Default is "manifests"
#SAS_MANIFEST_DIR: manifests

# The Kubernetes namespace that we are deploying into. Default is "sas-viya"
#SAS_K8S_NAMESPACE: sas-viya

# Reflects the domain to use when filling in the ingress paths. Default is "company.com"

#SECURE_CONSUL: false

# In the following structure, define the deployment_overrides per service that
# you want to end up in the generated manifests. This will add to or replace defaults
# For each service.deployment_overrides section, you can define the following:
#
# - environments
# - secrets
#

#custom_services:
#  sas-casserver-primary:
#    deployment_overrides:
#      environment:
#        - "CASCFG_MODE=mpp"

# In the following structures, define the custom volumes and volume mounts that
# are desired per service. If the same set of volumes and volume mounts are used
# across multiple services they will need to be defined per service. This will 
# add to or replace defaults. The structure is that everything after the pipe '|'
# is added to the manifest. It is a straight copy of what is provided to the
# generated manifest.

#custom_volume_mounts:
#  sas-casserver-primary: |
#    - name: someserver
